# Advertising companies say advertising is necessary and important. It informs
# people about new products. Advertising hoardings in the street make our
# environment colourful. And adverts on TV are often funny. Sometimes they
# are mini-dramas and we wait for the next programme in the mini-drama.
# Advertising can educate, too. Adverts tell us about new, healthy products.
# And adverts in magazines give us ideas for how to look prettier, be fashionable
# and be successful. Without advertising, life is boring and colourless.
# But some consumers argue that advertising is a bad thing. They say that
# advertising is bad for children. Adverts make children ‘pester’ their parents
# buy things for them. Advertisers know we love our children and want to give
# them everything. So they use children’s ‘pester power’ to sell their products.
# Finally, consumers say, if there is advertising there must be rules. Some
# adverts advertise unhealthy things like cigarettes and make people waste
# their money.
